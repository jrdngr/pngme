**pngme** lets you hide messages in PNG files.

If you're digging around and you think this look cool, stop reading and try to make it yourself! I made a lightly-guided guide here: https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/.

If you found this repo while you were working through the guide, you should not read any of this until your own implementation works. I promise it'll be worth it.
